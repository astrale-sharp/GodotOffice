# What is GodotOffice :
# The office suite you've waited for! made in the game engine you've waited for
# Godot office is born from a frustration with libreoffice
# Libreoffice is better than nothing but doesnt take you very far
# This is frustrating because its full of good ideas, poorly made
# The UI is counter intuitive
# The settings are hard to change, hard to understand
# A lot of subtile stuff is broken
# The experience overall is ... not great
# We can do better and that's what this project is about :
# learning from libreoffice mistakes
#
# What this project is not:
# A exact clone of every libreoffice features
# - I don't believe in MS Office and as such, compatibility with MS Office is not a goal
# - Some of libreoffice features are not that useful, they will not be implemented
# - The user should be encouraged
#
# Guidelines
# Lets strive to make a very clean elegant code, with every part separated and no duplication
# I believe a clean, simple infrastrure is key to a high quality software that can be developped and
# extended easily
#
# How
